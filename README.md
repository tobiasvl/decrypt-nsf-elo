# Decrypt NSF Elo

Decrypt the unofficial chess Elo ratings of NSF (Norsk sjakkforbund, the Norwegian Chess Federation).

This allows you to know a person's current rating between the published official rating lists. Note, however, that this rating is _unofficial_ and is subject to change (for instance in the case of wrongly reported tournaments that are re-rated).

## Usage

1. Download the latest unofficial rating list from NSF at http://www.sjakk.no/rating/siste.txt
2. Save it in the same directory as this script
3. Run this script: `python decrypt_elo.py`

## License and disclaimer

Please do not distribute this script and algorithm, and only decrypt the NSF ratings for your personal use. NSF does not wish the algorithm to be publicly known. Although they have not made any action toward anyone who has cracked the encryption, making the algorithm publicly available might entice them to change their decryption.
